# Calcite-Coral-and-Tuff-Oh-My
**Calcite, Coral, and Tuff, Oh My!** adds new recipes for crafting Calcite, Tuff, and all variants of Coral. Calcite and Tuff recipes are based off the existing Granite, Andesite and Diorite recipes, and Coral allows you to use either the regular Coral Plants or Coral Fans in a 2x2 recipe to craft all five coral variations.
